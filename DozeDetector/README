DozeDetector, a simple iOS app to help wake people up if they are dozing off.

Make sure your phone is not on "Silent" mode before starting, and turn up your ringer to a volume level you will hear.

Once you start the app, tap either "Calibrate" or "Detect" to start the video feed from the front camera. If you move your head, tap "Calibrate" again. If the app doesn't detect an eyes in the region, it will tell you to "wakeup."
